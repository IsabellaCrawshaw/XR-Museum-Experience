# XR-Museum-Experience
A collaborative mixed-reality museum experience where visitors scan artefacts, collect them, and later work together to recreate a historical building in AR. Users design rooms, explore others’ creations, exchange comments, and vote on past recreations, blending physical exhibits with shared digital interaction.
